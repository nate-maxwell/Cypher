Cypher text editor for writing python code.


## About the project

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8dnvsb3.png" alt="ui"/>

A fun project I work on occasionally in my spare time, originally created for me to
explore new things about PySide2 and Qt5.

For now, it is a simple text editor that has only a few simple features added,
and can only execute one tab's code at a time.

The goal is to eventually add a lexer and some intellisense to the project, and
allowing for full project development.
